    Computer hardware is a real thing compared to software. Hardware is what makes computers and things of such run. Software is not a hard real thing it is defined as the programs that are installed on computers. Examples of different hardware are motherboards, computer processing software(CPU), random access memory(RAM), Storage Drive (HDD or SSD), graphic processing unit(GPU), and keyboard and mouse. Your computer's motherboard is the hub that connects all the other pieces of hardware. The CPU is there to help your computer process different types of data. RAM and CPU work closely together to keep the computer running at a good rate. These are some of the most important parts of a computer.  A graphics processing unit is when GPU that processes vast amounts of graphical data and has a dedicated graphics card that's connected to the motherboard using an expansion slot. What is a PSU (power supply unit) a PSU takes electricity from an external power source like a laptop and with this power, it passes it to the motherboard to power certain hardware components. how do you see what hardware your computer has? to check what type of computers your laptop has you can use a crucial system scanner or a crucial system selector. You can also check your hardware through settings or by physically checking the labels on the hardware.     </body>
